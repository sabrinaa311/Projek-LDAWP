# How to Run The Dashboard
### Setup environment
In this case, I have had an environment called `sparta_da` that contains the list of packages that required. So, I should activate that environment.

```
conda activate sparta_da
```
### Create the file `.py`
I use Visual Studio Code to create the file. The file contains codes that will present what you want in the dashboard. In this case, my file `.py` is called `project_dashboard1`.

# Run Streamlit app
To run codes in file `.py`, you need to open your terminal (me: command prompt) and navigate the path to the `project_dashboard.py ` folder that was previously created. For example you can see what I did.

```
(sparta_da) C:\Users\HP> D: #I put my file in D
(sparta_da) D:\> dir #I wanna check the contains of directory D
(sparta_da) D:\ cd BANGKIT #I change my directory to folder BANGKIT
(sparta_da) D:\BANGKIT> streamlit run dashboard_project1.py # run streamlit app
```
